author-about: >-
  A results-driven software developer. I thoroughly enjoy working in unison with
  others to solve complex problems. I have a passion for constant self-growth
  and improvement. Finding fulfillment in work was the most substantial
  contributor to my career transition into Software development. Before finding
  my appreciation for software development, I worked in financial sales for
  seven years. I was able to thrive in my previous role through my constant
  desire to improve, learn, and teach others. 


  Have a passion for building 3D models and environments for Virtual Reality.  I
  spend much of my free time exploring technologies such as Blender, Unity, C#,
  amplify, etc. that I utilize in the creation of VR environments. I love to
  learn from and teach others. Communities that cultivate a collaborative
  culture will always thrive,  innovate, and inspire others. This is why I
  strive to cultivate collaboration in all endeavors I take on. Be it at work or
  through my hobbies in programming, music, or 3D modeling.
