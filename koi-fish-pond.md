title: Koi Pond (WIP)

> **Koi fish pond built in Unity for a Virtual Environment. Koi fish
    responsively detect and avoid walls, seek out food, and reproduce. Koi fish
    offspring inherit the colors of their parents.**

### Event Triggers
> The Koi fish have gravity applied upon leaving the water, and taken off when entering back into the water

### Swimming
> The Koi fish will reorient themselves to face upright when being put back into water.

> The Koi will avoid running into walls. This will be expanded upon in the future to give them multiple actions they can take upon first detecting a wall. For now they will just turn away from it.

### Food
> Spawn in food that can be given to the fish. Food gains gravity when dropped, and has a simple function to float when thrown into the water.

> Feed the Koi and watch them grow. Koi will grow to a max size, which will then allow them to have offspring.

### Swap Koi
> Don't like the colors of one of the Koi fish? Swap them out for a new Koi with randomly generated colors.

### Cook Koi
> Feeling a bit more destructive? Throw the koi into the "fire" and cook them. The spawned in cooked Koi will be the same size as the fresh Koi was.

### Shader
> The shader is very early on and still a big work in progress much like everything else. This shader was built using a node-based shader creation tool called Amplify. The main goals of this shader are to give the fish two distinct colors ,and a pattern that can be altered via propreity blocks in the C# code, and to give the Koi fish the appearance of wiggling in the water.

> This gives the Koi a pattern with two distinct colors. Need to find an alternative solution to the noise generator as it is an unoptimized solution to creating a pattern.
